## Welcome

My name is **Clark Carter**, I'm an experimenter of code and lover of [adventure](http://www.adventureplaybook.com/about/). I'm also the Operations Manager for Jira Projects at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/). Here's some apps I'm building whilst exploring the wonders of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

- [Background Color Changer](https://github.com/clarkcarter/bg-colour-changer)
- [Countdown Timer](https://github.com/clarkcarter/timer)
- [Weather App](https://github.com/clarkcarter/weather)
- [Multi-Step Form](https://github.com/clarkcarter/multi-step-form)
- [Todo List](https://github.com/clarkcarter/todo)

And that's that. Feel free to [say hi](mailto:clark@clarkcarter.com).
